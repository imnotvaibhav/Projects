# Projects
A loan application is used by borrowers to apply for a loan. Through the loan application, borrowers reveal key details about their finances to the lender. The loan application is crucial to determining whether the lender will grant the request for funds or credit.

## Project Highlights:
* Data Exploration: Employed exploratory data analysis (EDA), univariate analysis, and bivariate analysis to gain insights into the data.
* Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values through imputation and handled outliers to ensure data quality.
* Feature Engineering: Created new features through feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model performance.
* Machine Learning Model Building: Built and evaluated various machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees.
* Model Evaluation: Used metrics like F1-score and ROC curves to assess the effectiveness of the models.
